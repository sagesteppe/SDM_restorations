Species Distribution Models have been shown to be semi-quantitative, i.e. be able to predict species abundance from suitability scores,  under various scenarios.
Here we determine whether a positive relationship exists between the mean predicted habitat suitability of a patch, or a sector of large patches, and the percent aerial cover of the taxon on an AIM plot.  

```{r identify relevant AIM Plots}
 
```

```{r extract AIM percent covers}
```
